# Micro-Service Project 💻🌐

## Description 📝

The **Micro-Service Project** is a **distributed microservices-based application** that fetches, stores, and provides **real-time currency exchange rates**. Built with scalability and efficiency in mind, this project integrates with the **NBP API** to collect currency rates every minute, stores the data in a **database** for durability, and uses **RabbitMQ** for seamless communication between services. Users can securely convert currencies or check the latest rates via a **REST API**, protected by **Keycloak** authentication. Additionally, the system sends **email notifications** to users after currency conversions, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.

This project is **actively under development** and serves as both a practical tool and a learning platform for building **scalable microservices**. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome! 🚀
